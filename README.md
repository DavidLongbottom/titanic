# titanic
this repo try to show all methods to over-fit kaggle's titanic data

I just want to use any kinds of methods to predict titanic data. I do this just because I want to write code and practice ML/DL
Also today is 2020-01-01,I want to have a good start in the 20s,get rid of anime(I watch damn a lot).

Just have fun!!!
And Happy New Year!
